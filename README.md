# Aave Wallet Credit Scoring Model

This project provides a machine learning model to assign a credit score to wallets on the Aave V2 protocol. The score, ranging from 0 to 1000, is based on a wallet's historical transaction behavior. Higher scores indicate more reliable and responsible usage of the protocol, while lower scores may reflect riskier or bot-like behavior.

## Methodology

Due to the absence of labeled data (i.e., pre-existing, verified credit scores), this model employs an unsupervised, heuristic-based approach. We engineer several features from the raw transaction data that are indicative of a user's financial health and behavior within the Aave protocol. Each feature is assigned a weight based on its perceived importance in determining creditworthiness. These weighted features are then combined to produce a final credit score.

## Architecture

The model is implemented in a single Python script (`credit_scoring_model.py`) that performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Loads the raw transaction data from a JSON file.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creates a set of features for each wallet.  
3. **Scoring**: Applies a weighted scoring algorithm to the engineered features to calculate a credit score for each wallet.  
4. **Output**: Saves the wallet addresses and their corresponding credit scores to a CSV file.

## Processing Flow

### Load Data

The script starts by loading the `user-wallet-transactions.json` file into a pandas DataFrame.

### Feature Engineering

The following features are engineered for each wallet:

- **Transaction Frequency**: Total number of transactions.  
- **Total Transaction Volume (USD)**: The sum of the value of all transactions in USD.  
- **Liquidation History**: The number of times a wallet has been liquidated.  
- **Repayment History**: The number of times a wallet has repaid a loan.  
- **Deposit-to-Borrow Ratio**: The ratio of deposits to borrows, indicating how much of their borrowing is backed by their own assets.  
- **Wallet Age**: The number of days since the wallet's first transaction.

## Scoring Logic

- The features are normalized to a 0â€“1 scale to ensure fair comparison.
- A weighted sum of the normalized features is calculated to generate a raw score. The weights are defined as follows:

  | Feature                  | Weight  |
  |--------------------------|---------|
  | Transaction Count        | 15%     |
  | Total Volume (USD)       | 25%     |
  | Liquidation Penalty      | -40%    |
  | Repayment Reward         | 30%     |
  | Deposit-to-Borrow Ratio  | 20%     |
  | Wallet Age Bonus         | 10%     |

- The final credit score is then scaled to a range of **0 to 1000**.
