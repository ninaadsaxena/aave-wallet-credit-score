# Analysis of Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scores

This document provides an analysis of the credit scores assigned to Aave V2 wallets based on their historical transaction behavior, as generated by the `credit_scoring_model.py` script. The scores range from 0 to 1000, with higher scores indicating more reliable and responsible usage.

## Score Distribution

The distribution of credit scores provides an overview of the overall creditworthiness of the wallets in the dataset. When the `credit_scoring_model.py` script is executed, it generates and saves a bar chart (`score_distribution.png`) showing the number of wallets within each 100-point score range (e.g., 0–100, 100–200, ..., 900–1000).

### Interpretation of Distribution:

- A normal-like distribution would suggest a wide range of behaviors, with most wallets exhibiting average responsibility.
- A left-skewed distribution (more high scores) would indicate a dataset dominated by responsible users.
- A right-skewed distribution (more low scores) might suggest a significant number of risky or bot-like wallets.

## Behavior of Wallets in the Lower Range (0–300)

Wallets scoring in the lower range are typically characterized by behaviors that the model identifies as risky or unestablished. Based on the scoring logic in the script, these wallets are likely to exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

- **High Number of Liquidations (`liquidation_count`)**: This is the strongest negative indicator, carrying a -40% weight. Wallets that have been liquidated demonstrate a failure to manage their collateral effectively and are considered high-risk.
- **Low Total Transaction Volume (`total_volume_usd`)**: Wallets with very small transaction volumes in USD suggest limited participation or a lack of significant capital commitment to the protocol.
- **Low Deposit-to-Borrow Ratio**: A low number of deposit actions compared to borrow actions indicates that the wallet is taking on debt without a strong history of providing collateral, which is flagged as risky behavior.
- **Low Repayment History (`repay_count`)**: A low number of repayments is a direct sign of poor debt management.
- **Recent Wallet Age (`wallet_age_days`)**: Newer wallets have not had the time to establish a long-term, positive track record, which results in a lower score.

## Behavior of Wallets in the Higher Range (700–1000)

Wallets achieving high credit scores demonstrate consistent, responsible, and active participation within the Aave V2 protocol. Their transaction patterns align with reliable usage:

- **Zero Liquidations (`liquidation_count`)**: The absence of liquidation events is a critical positive factor, showing effective management of their positions and avoidance of risk.
- **Significant Total Transaction Volume (`total_volume_usd`)**: High-scoring wallets typically have substantial transaction volumes, indicating significant and active participation in the Aave ecosystem. This feature has a 25% weight.
- **High Repayment History (`repay_count`)**: These wallets consistently repay their loans. A high number of repayments contributes positively with a 30% weight.
- **Healthy Deposit-to-Borrow Ratio**: High-scoring wallets show a strong history of deposits relative to their borrowing activity, indicating they are well-collateralized.
- **Sustained Activity (`transaction_count` and `wallet_age_days`)**: These wallets show a healthy number of transactions spread over a longer duration. A long wallet history provides a 10% bonus, and a high transaction count contributes 15% to the score, indicating genuine, long-term engagement.

## Conclusion

The heuristic-based credit scoring model effectively differentiates wallet behaviors by leveraging key engineered features from Aave V2 transaction data.

- High-scoring wallets exhibit responsible debt management (high repayments, healthy deposit ratios), consistent engagement, and, most importantly, an absence of liquidations.
- Low-scoring wallets are often characterized by multiple liquidations, poor repayment habits, and limited or very recent activity.

This analysis confirms that the model successfully translates on-chain behavior into a meaningful credit score.
